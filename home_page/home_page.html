            Hello! We are the Bakers.
            During the HackTues competition, we conducted a study on the health of astronauts.
            The Cosmos has been known since ancient times and over time the idea of ​​it has changed.
            The first human collision with space dates back to before or you can use " prior to " instead of "
            before" the new era.
            It has appeared in many different forms. In the Greek Mythology Cosmos or Chaos is a place
            between the sky and the earth.
            Whatever understanding the humans or the human beings had about the
            space, they were all about the harmony and the beauty.
            As much shining and breath-taking the night sky is, so it is dangerous. However shining and
            breathtaking the night sky might be, it is dangerous.
            All of us know that the conditions for life in space are very unappealing./unwelcoming
            That is why a great deal of the astronauts who returned (return) from space are with a really bad
            disease. That is why a great deal of the astronauts who return from space are badly affected by
            various diseases.
